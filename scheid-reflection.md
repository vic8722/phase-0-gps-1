##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The biggest git-related concepts I was struggling with prior to this GPS were the nuts and bolts of how git pull, fetch and merge work and the appropriate way to integrate all of those commands to make development with peers easier. This GPS session really helped me better understand how you can use all of them together to make safe changes to your code and keep everything neat and tidy.

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
After this session I feel like I have a much stronger understanding of the way that pull requests are supposed to work within teams and how to merge feature branches with the master branch.


##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked the guide to help me understand what was actually happening under the hood when you make a fetch request. My pair and I were asking each other questions frequently throughout the exercise about the best names to use for commits, how we should tackle the problem etc. It felt very collaborative.

##What still confuses you about git?
I feel pretty confident with what we've learned of git so far. I'm still confused by some of the things that we haven't covered. I'd also like to get a better understanding of how to effectively rollback changes and navigate around to different commits. Recently, I messed something up and lost a whole file and wasn't able to figure out how to get it back. With a little more knowledge, I don't think that would be a problem anymore.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Great! I loved it. My pair was really awesome and our guide was helpful. I'm a little disappointed that we didn't get through the whole challenge in the time allotted. I feel like we could have if we had hurried a little bit more but it didn't seem to be a hurried exercise and our guide definitely wasn't moving us along. If anything, Adell slowed us down to make sure we understood some new concepts and taught us tips and tricks, which was great, I just hope it doesn't negatively impact our ability to move out of Phase-0 in the long run.
