- What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I didn't particularly understand what `git fetch` and `git merge` did since I hadn't tried them out. Now I feel like I understand a little better after seeing it in action.

- What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Our guide helped to clarify some general questions as well as showed us some cool tricks. For example, using command + clicking on several locations in Sublime allows you to edit multiple rows at once.

- What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked the pair and guide about logging into GitHub through the terminal every time a push was sent through. Our guide said there's a way to setup the SSH on GitHub and in the terminal that will automatically pass the login information for you so you don't have to do it everytime. _Very_ useful information.

- What still confuses you about git?

I'm not sure I'm confused about much anymore. It's all starting to come together.


- How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was pretty good! I was pretty nervous, but I think it went well. We didn't finish the entire challenge in our allotted time, but stayed on a bit after to finish up. Pretty pleased with the process overall.
